# Car Parking Sensor ðŸš—

A simple parking safety system built as part of my Standard Embedded diploma at Edges For Training. This project uses an ATmega32 microcontroller and an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and help prevent collisions during parking.

**Features:**
- Ultrasonic Distance Measurement: Detects and displays distance on an LCD.
- LED Indicators: Red, Green, and Blue LEDs light up based on proximity.
- Buzzer Alert: Sounds when an obstacle is closer than 5 cm.
  
**LED & Buzzer Behavior**
- â‰¤ 5 cm: All LEDs flash + buzzer + "Stop" on LCD.
- 6-10 cm: All LEDs ON (no buzzer).
- 11-15 cm: Red and Green LEDs ON.
- 16-20 cm: Red LED ON.
> 20 cm: All LEDs OFF + buzzer OFF
